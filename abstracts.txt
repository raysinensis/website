The zinc finger protein tristetraprolin (TTP) promotes translation repression and degradation of mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs). Although much attention has been directed toward understanding the decay process and machinery involved, the translation repression role of TTP has remained poorly understood. Here we identify the cap-binding translation repression 4EHP-GYF2 complex as a cofactor of TTP. Immunoprecipitation and in vitro pull-down assays demonstrate that TTP associates with the 4EHP-GYF2 complex via direct interaction with GYF2, and mutational analyses show that this interaction occurs via conserved tetraproline motifs of TTP. Mutant TTP with diminished 4EHP-GYF2 binding is impaired in its ability to repress a luciferase reporter ARE-mRNA. 4EHP knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) display increased induction and slower turnover of TTP-target mRNAs as compared to wild-type MEFs. Our work highlights the function of the conserved tetraproline motifs of TTP and identifies 4EHP-GYF2 as a cofactor in translational repression and mRNA decay by TTP.
Widespread mRNA decay, an unappreciated feature of apoptosis, enhances cell death and depends on mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), TUTases, and DIS3L2. Which RNAs are decayed and the decay-initiating event are unknown. Here, we show extensive decay of mRNAs and poly(A) noncoding (nc)RNAs at the 3′ end, triggered by the mitochondrial intermembrane space 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease PNPT1, released during MOMP. PNPT1 knockdown inhibits apoptotic RNA decay and reduces apoptosis, while ectopic expression of PNPT1, but not an RNase-deficient mutant, increases RNA decay and cell death. The 3′ end of PNPT1 substrates thread through a narrow channel. Many non-poly(A) ncRNAs contain 3′-secondary structures or bind proteins that may block PNPT1 activity. Indeed, mutations that disrupt the 3′-stem-loop of a decay-resistant ncRNA render the transcript susceptible, while adding a 3′-stem-loop to an mRNA prevents its decay. Thus, PNPT1 release from mitochondria during MOMP initiates apoptotic decay of RNAs lacking 3′-structures.
Assignment of cell types from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data remains a time-consuming and error-prone process. Current packages for identity assignment use limited types of reference data and often have rigid data structure requirements. We developed the clustifyr R package to leverage several external data types, including gene expression profiles to assign likely cell types using data from scRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, microarray expression data, or signature gene lists. We benchmark various parameters of a correlation-based approach and implement gene list enrichment methods. clustifyr is a lightweight and effective cell-type assignment tool developed for compatibility with various scRNA-seq analysis workflows.
Single cell RNA sequencing provides an unprecedented view of cellular diversity of biological systems. Thousands of scRNA-seq datasets have been generated, providing a wealth of biological data on the diversity of cell types across different organisms, developmental stages, and disease states. But while a tremendous number of publications and datasets have been generated using this technology, we found that a minority (< 25%) of studies provide sufficient information to enable direct reuse of their data for further studies. This problem is common across journals, data repositories, and publication dates. The lack of appropriate information not only hinders exploration and knowledge transfer of reported data, but also makes reproducing the original study prohibitively difficult and/or time-consuming. Correcting this problem is not easy but we encourage investigators, reviewers, journals, and data repositories to take steps to improve their standards and ensure proper documentation of these valuable datasets.
Hibernation is a physiological and behavioral phenotype that minimizes energy expenditure. Hibernators cycle between profound depression and rapid hyperactivation of multiple physiological processes, challenging our concept of mammalian homeostasis. How the hibernator orchestrates and survives these extremes while maintaining cell to organismal viability is unknown. Here, we enhance the genome integrity and annotation of a model hibernator, the 13-lined ground squirrel. Our new assembly brings this genome to near chromosome-level contiguity and adds thousands of previously unannotated genes. These new genomic resources were used to identify 6,505 hibernation-related, differentially-expressed and processed transcripts using RNA-seq data from three brain regions in animals whose physiological status was precisely defined using body temperature telemetry. A software tool, squirrelBox, was developed to foster further data analyses and visualization. SquirrelBox includes a comprehensive toolset for rapid visualization of gene level and cluster group dynamics, sequence scanning of k-mer and domains, and interactive exploration of gene lists. Using these new tools and data, we deconvolute seasonal from temperature-dependent effects on the brain transcriptome during hibernation for the first time, highlighting the importance of carefully timed samples for studies of differential gene expression in hibernation. The identified genes include a regulatory network of RNA binding proteins that are dynamic in hibernation along with the composition of the RNA pool. In addition to passive effects of temperature, we provide evidence for regulated transcription and RNA turnover during hibernation. Significant alternative splicing, largely temperature dependent, also occurs during hibernation. These findings form a crucial first step and provide a roadmap for future work toward defining novel mechanisms of tissue protection and metabolic depression that may 1 day be applied toward improving human health.
Angiotensin II (AngII) binds to the type I angiotensin receptor in the adrenal cortex to initiate a cascade of events leading to the production of aldosterone, a master regulator of blood pressure. Despite extensive characterization of the transcriptional and enzymatic control of adrenocortical steroidogenesis, there are still major gaps in our knowledge related to precise regulation of AII-induced gene expression kinetics. Specifically, we do not know the regulatory contribution of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and RNA decay, which can control the timing of stimulus-induced gene expression. To investigate this question, we performed a high-resolution RNA-seq time course of the AngII stimulation response and 4-thiouridine pulse labeling in a steroidogenic human cell line (H295R). We identified twelve temporally distinct gene expression responses that contained mRNA encoding proteins known to be important for various steps of aldosterone production, such as cAMP signaling components and steroidogenic enzymes. AngII response kinetics for many of these mRNAs revealed a coordinated increase in both synthesis and decay. These findings were validated in primary human adrenocortical cells stimulated ex vivo with AngII. Using a candidate siRNA screen, we identified a subset of RNA-binding protein and RNA decay factors that activate or repress AngII-stimulated aldosterone production. Among the repressors of aldosterone were BTG2, which promotes deadenylation and global RNA decay. BTG2 was induced in response to AngII stimulation and promoted the repression of mRNAs encoding pro-steroidogenic factors indicating the existence of an incoherent feedforward loop controlling aldosterone homeostasis. Together, these data support a model in which coordinated increases in transcription and regulated RNA decay facilitates the major transcriptomic changes required to implement a pro-steroidogenic gene expression program that is temporally restricted to prevent aldosterone overproduction.
