## About me
<img align="left" width="200" height="200" src="RuiFu.jpg" style="margin:20px">
I am a biologist and bioinformaticist. Originally from China, I finished my PhD at University of California San Diego, and received postdoctoral training at Boston Children's Hospital of Harvard Medical School and University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.

I performed molecular bench experiment research from 2007-2017, mainly in the field of RNA-binding proteins and RNA degradation. Since then, I have worked on computational skills to analyze sequencing and genomic data, still with a focus on RNA.

The current position also gave me more teaching opportunities, in both basic biology and coding, that have been greatly rewarding.

In my free time, I am an avid reader, blue collar basketball player, cat lover, and frequent volunteer at the local zoo/aquarium/museum, trying to instill my enthusiasm for science into the public.
